# HackMIT2022

With a base website template set up as the foundation of our project, our team plans to implement two separate APIs in an attempt to connect them to each other for maximum efficiency. The two APIs we will use are the Mapbox API and the Carbon Interface API. With these two APIs set up, users can not only predetermine their vacation/leisure/business trips based on travel time and other general satellite map functions, but they can also track how much carbon they would be releasing into the environment for certain trips. The site itself would recommend the route that is the perfect medium between sustainable measures for carbon emissions and efficient traveling for the user's convenience. If the user's monthly carbon usage is less than the average of all users that month, they will be rewarded with CarbonKash which they can exchange for goods. The website will also be given an aesthetic, minimalistic design through the JekyllxBulma Theme template for improved user interface.
